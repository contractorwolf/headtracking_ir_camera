# headtracking_ir_camera


The hardware for this project is made using the IR camera from a wiimote.  The camera can output the X and Y coordinates 
of any IR spot (up to 4) that it saw in its view so I made a way of displaying and interpreting that as the head 
orientation.  You can see it in action here:
